# stock-option-profit-graph

This project focuses on generating a profit/loss table and graph for a stock and option strategy. The goal is to analyze the profit/loss outcomes of combining multiple stocks and options. Implemented using Python, the project prompts the user for input regarding the stock and option details, and then visualizes the profit/loss scenario of the strategy.

The approach involves the following steps:

Gathering user input for stock and option details (option type, call/put, strike price, option price, spot stock price, etc.).
Calculating the profit/loss outcomes for each option.
Visualizing the profit/loss scenario on a graph.
Upon running the project, the user is prompted to enter the necessary details related to the stock and options. After providing the input, the program generates and displays the profit/loss graph for the strategy.
